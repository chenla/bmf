Weights:

 -  confidence-weight
 -  probablistic-weight 

hunches:

It's worthless for humans to state numerical preferences.
All sorts of cognitive biases kick in.  But it's not bad to
provide a hunch which a baysian algorthm can use as a
starting point to determine certainty and propability.

So we will use very basic words to indicate a hunch that a
statement is true or false, and certainty is low medium or
high.  Some people will want to use more precision but at
the moment I don't see helping much and will likely make
things worse.  After all this is a hunch and hunches are
best guesses.

   true|false  nil|low|medium|high

** inline markup

markup statements within a text.  A statement is any
assertion that something is true or false


[Prai Yut] was born on [20 feb 2044] in [Bangkok-Phuket
Hospital] at 9:22 in the evening.

   So:
        sub:  per:PraiYut_Jaksan 
        pre:  rel:born
        obj:  dt:2044-2-20:21:22
        src:  self

        sub:  per:PraiYut_Jaksan
        pre:  rel:born
        obj:  geo:Bangkok_Phuket_Hospital
        src:  self

Always try to place the markup on the object.

---

What if we put the metadata at the end of the document,
together with the notes and bibliography?  

  - notes       :fn:
  - references  :ref:
  - statements  :stmt:
  - links       :lnk: rich links?

in org we can then do using subheadings with property boxes

When we create 


#+begin_example
**   key                                                              :fnord:

This should result in the following two quads:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
("per:PraiYut_Jaksan" "rel:born" "dt:2044-2-20T21:22+7:00"
  ((bmf:id     "802f09ec-03ce-4792-b397-8bb58104f9f5")
   (bmf:owner  "per:deerpig")
   (bmf:stamp  "created:2018-07-04T10:29:56+07:00")
   {bmf:src    "file:projects.org::**heading")
   (bmf:ref    "yut:2044birth-cert")
   (bmf:hunch  "true high")
   (bmf:access "w+w+r+")
   (bmf:agent  "per:deerpig")
   (bmf:acton  "create")))
("per:PraiYut_Jaksan" "rel:born" "geo:Bangkok_Phuket_Hospital")
  ((bmf:id     "91363162-113a-42e3-a322-16a09ae47e3c")

   {bmf:src    "file:projects.org::**heading") ;; or id#
   (bmf:ref    "yut:2044birth-cert") ;; key to local record
   (bmf:hunch  "true high")
   (bmf:access "w+w+r+")
   (bmf:agent  "per:deerpig")
   (bmf:acton  "create")))
#+end_src

These would be parsed, processed, certainties and
probabilities calculated and woven into to the horcruxes'
graph db.  They will then propagate and be added to all
other horcruxes in the hoard.

I don't know how important it will be for horcruxes to
maintain identical mirror databases. Each horcrux will find
add it's own quad to it's own quadstore, propagate and
integrate locally.  So at any one time, the different dbs
will have a slightly different model, depending on the
context of what they are doing and how up to date they are
relative to the other horcruxes.  I think in the end this
will be a feature not a bug.  It won't result in different
facts being given by different horcruxes as much as slightly
different contexts depending on what each horcrux is doing.

Remember as well that all horcruxes will maintain a
blockchain that will establish concensus on which quad from
which horcrux becomes the canonical id and source for a
quad.

** Fnords

I originally wanted to use STMT to mean any statement or
assertion.  We could also use the term 'fact' but that
implies that it is a truth statement.  We certainly don't
want to have binary terms such as fact and lie because in a
none trivial number of cases context determines if something
is true or not.  The Capital of Laos is Vientiene is true
today, but The Capital of Laos is Luang Prabang was also
true in the past.

But we need something more general purpose.  So let's dust
off fnord.

A fnord is an assertion where all possible values for that
assertion are valid.  Not all values; only causally possible
values.

When fnord is observed, the assertion is seen within a
specific context of references to other assertions.  When
this happens the possibility wave collapses to a
single value or a narrow range of possible values and we can
say that within this concept something it true or false and
have a value that represents the magnitude of certainty that
it is true or false.

There are other types of fnords which are types of queries
where the value of a quad is not known.  This is where AI
comes in, and makes a best guess as to what the answer might
be.  This is both for guessing what will happen in the
future, or for filling in blanks in existing local knowledge
to guess what something might be that you can only
indirectly infer or deduce.

This is a core function of BMF-Saltmine as an externalized
local model of the world from a specific context.

People, Groups and AIs will all use this system to
externalize their own "black box" cognitive processes.  In
this way, the hoard's map becomes a means to understand what
and how anyone understands how they see the world and how
they came to those conclusions.  So this is a tool for
off-loading cognitive processing of memories, but also a way
to communicate to others and provide an interopporibility
layer between two different hoards.

Since hoards are shattered into multiple horcruxes
(shatterlings) this is also the mechanism that is used to
merge Î”s when horcuxes syncronize.
