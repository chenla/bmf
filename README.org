The Burr Metadata Framework (BMF) is the original name given for a set
of specifications for what we call /semantic storage/.  The goal was
to create very long term electronic storage systems that preserved the
surrounding context of what was being stored as well as the file being
stored.  This would guard against /semantic rot/ where information
looses it's meaning as the surrounding context erodes over time.
Names of people, places and events get lost over time.

We are in the process of transitioning BMF from an archival format, to
a active living format that preserves context as it changes over
time.  This will become part of the Saltmine Platform.  We're still
not sure if we will be keeping the name, as many of the names in
Saltmine overlap with concepts in BMF.   For example, in BMF, a
/bramble/ is functionally equivilent to a /hoard/ in Saltmine.

A paper was published describing BMF in 2006 for the Extreme Markup
Conference in Montreal.  The spec has since undergone three major
revisions, though they were never published.  This repo will collect
much of that unpublished material to create several specifications
that will be used for Saltmine.
